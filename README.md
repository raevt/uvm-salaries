This project seeks to review the features of the University of Vermontâ€™s 2022 base salaries, with a focus on the differences between lecturer and professor pay.

More accurately...this is a dataset for me to practice data visualization with in Stata 18.

It would be useful to be able to sort this data by part-time staff. Doing some spot-checking on the hundreds of professors with pay from 25,000 to 35,000, it seems most if not all are medical staff, which is presumably reflective only of their teaching income. I could make an arbitrary cut-off at some point in that range, but that would not necessarily be accurate. What is clear is that there are spikes in low-paid part-time professors and lecturers which skew analyses.
